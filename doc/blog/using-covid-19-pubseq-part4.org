* What does this mean?

When someone uploads a SARS-CoV-2 sequence using one
of our tools (CLI or web-based) they add a sequence and some metadata
which triggers a rerun of our workflows.

* Where can I find the workflows?

Workflows are written in the common workflow language (CWL) and listed
on [[https://github.com/arvados/bh20-seq-resource/tree/master/workflows][github]]. PubSeq being an open project these workflows can be studied
and modified!

* Modify Workflow

/Work in progress!/
